# Car rental website 

This is a car rental project made with Django | Chart.js | Jquery | Bootstrap 4 and stripe.js payments.
I always loved one particular car manufacturer so I made this website that let's you rent most thrilling vehicles from this manufacturer portfolio

## Important info
You need to create dummy account to "rent out" cars. You need to know that the hosting is free so the app is freezed when no one is physically on the website hence long loading times
